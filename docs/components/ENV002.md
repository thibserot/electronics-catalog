# LDR 5528 - ENV002

A **5528-series light-dependent resistor (LDR)** is a simple cadmium-sulfide (CdS) photoresistor. Its resistance drops as the light level increases, which makes it ideal as a very cheap, analog **ambient light sensor** for things like night-lights, auto-dimming displays, and “it’s dark / it’s bright” detection.

This specific GL5528-style part is a 5 mm epoxy-encapsulated LDR. In typical conditions it measures on the order of tens of kilo-ohms in moderate light and rises to around a megaohm in the dark, so it works very well in a classic voltage-divider configuration with a fixed resistor and an ESP32 ADC pin.

## Specifications

Approximate characteristics for a typical GL5528/5528 LDR:

- **Package:** 5 mm CdS photoresistor (2-pin, through-hole)
- **Light resistance (bright, ~10 lux):** ~10–20 kΩ
- **Dark resistance (0 lux):** ≥ 1 MΩ
- **Maximum DC voltage:** ~150 V
- **Maximum power dissipation:** ~100 mW (at 25 °C)
- **Spectral peak:** ~540 nm (green)
- **Response time:** tens of milliseconds (order of 20–50 ms)
- **Operating temperature:** roughly −30 °C to +70 °C

These values are not precision-guaranteed for every random AliExpress batch, but they’re good ballpark numbers for choosing divider resistors and thresholds.

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

This is just the bare **2‑lead LDR component**, not a module, so there is no real “pinout”:

- **Pin 1:** LDR terminal (no polarity)
- **Pin 2:** LDR terminal (no polarity)

You use it exactly like a variable resistor. Orientation does **not** matter. There is no I²C/SPI address or digital interface – you must build a simple resistor divider to read it with an ADC.

## Wiring

The classic way to use an LDR with an ESP32 is as a **voltage divider**:

1. Pick a fixed resistor value, typically in the same order of magnitude as the LDR in the mid-light range, e.g. **10 kΩ**.
2. Connect one LDR leg to **3.3 V**.
3. Connect the other LDR leg to:
   - the **ESP32 analog input pin**, e.g. GPIO 34 (ADC1_CH6), and
   - one side of the fixed resistor (**10 kΩ**) at the same node.
4. Connect the **other side of the fixed resistor** to **GND**.

That node between LDR and fixed resistor goes to the ESP32 ADC input. As light increases, the LDR resistance drops, changing the voltage at the ADC pin.

Notes:

- Use only **ADC-capable pins** on the ESP32 (e.g. 32–39 on most dev boards).
- Keep the divider tied to **3.3 V**, never 5 V, to avoid overstressing the ESP32.
- If needed, you can add a small capacitor (e.g. 0.1 µF) from the ADC node to GND to filter noise and ESP32 ADC sampling glitches.

## Gotchas

- **Not a precision lux sensor** – good for thresholds (“dark vs bright”), not for accurate lux readings.
- **Device-to-device variation** is large; you may need to tune thresholds per build.
- **Non-linear and slowish response** compared to photodiodes/phototransistors – not suitable for fast light changes or data links.
- Contains **CdS (cadmium sulfide)**; some regions have restrictions on cadmium-containing devices.
- Always use it in a **divider**, not directly across 3.3 V into an ADC pin.

## How to use

Simple example for an ESP32 (Arduino framework) reading the LDR via a voltage divider and turning an LED on when it’s dark.

```cpp
// Simple ESP32 LDR example
// LDR + 10k resistor in divider:
// 3V3 --- LDR --- ADC_PIN --- 10k --- GND

const int LDR_PIN = 34;     // ADC-capable pin
const int LED_PIN = 2;      // Built-in LED on many ESP32 dev boards

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int raw = analogRead(LDR_PIN);   // 0..4095 on most ESP32 boards

  // Simple threshold: adjust to taste
  bool isDark = (raw < 1500);

  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, isDark ? HIGH : LOW);

  Serial.print("LDR raw = ");
  Serial.print(raw);
  Serial.print(" -> ");
  Serial.println(isDark ? "Dark" : "Bright");

  delay(200);
}
```

No special libraries are required – just the standard Arduino core for ESP32. You can refine this by:

- Mapping the ADC value to a “percentage light”.
- Implementing hysteresis for stable switching.
- Sampling and averaging to reduce noise.
