# 1-Channel Relay Module - AC008

Single-channel relay *board* with optocoupler input and jumper-selectable trigger level (HIGH or LOW). Use it to safely switch mains or higher-current DC loads from an ESP32 GPIO via an isolated input stage. Typical variants are available with 5 V or 12 V coils. If you need more than one channel, use multi‑relay boards instead.

## Specifications

- Optocoupler‑isolated input stage
- Operating voltage (coil): **5 V or 12 V** (board variant)
- Trigger: **HIGH or LOW** selectable via on‑board jumper
- Indicators: **Power LED** and **Relay status LED**
- **Max load:** **AC 250 V / 10 A**, **DC 30 V / 10 A** (depends on relay fitted; verify on your part)
- Control input **IN** requires ≳ **4 mA** drive current (from listing)
- Output contacts: **COM**, **NO**, (**NC** is present on most modules even if the listing only calls out COM)

> Values above were taken from the AliExpress listing. If your board has a different relay model, follow that relay's datasheet limits.

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

**Header / screw terminals (I/O side):**
- **DC+ (VCC):** Board power for the input/driver (5 V or 12 V version)
- **DC− (GND):** Ground
- **IN:** Control input from microcontroller
- **Jumper:** Selects **HIGH** or **LOW** trigger

**Relay terminals (load side):**
- **COM:** Common contact
- **NO:** Normally‑Open (closes to COM when active)
- **NC:** Normally‑Closed (opens from COM when active)

> Some one‑channel boards expose COM/NO only; others provide COM/NO/NC.

## Wiring

Assuming a **5 V** relay module with an **ESP32**:

- Power the module **DC+ = 5 V**, **DC− = GND** from a 5 V supply.  
  *(Don’t power the relay coil from the ESP32 3.3 V pin.)*
- Connect **ESP32 GND ↔ DC−** (common ground).
- Connect an ESP32 GPIO (e.g., **GPIO 26**) to **IN**.
- Place the jumper to match your preferred trigger (**LOW** or **HIGH**).  
- Wire your load to the **COM/NO/NC** screw terminals as needed. For mains, break **only one** conductor (active/hot) and keep neutral/earth intact.

## Gotchas

- **Mains safety:** Treat anything on the relay terminals as **high voltage**. Use proper creepage/clearance and insulated enclosures. If unsure, stick to **low‑voltage DC** loads.
- **Active‑LOW vs ACTIVE‑HIGH:** Many boards default to **active‑LOW**. Use the jumper to choose, and match it in code.
- **Board variants:** Some modules have separate JD‑VCC/VCC pins for true opto‑isolation; this board appears to use **DC+/DC−** only (shared ground).
- **Contact ratings:** 10 A is the **maximum** under ideal conditions. For inductive loads (motors, solenoids), derate and consider snubbers/RC or MOVs.

## How to use

Very simple example (Arduino framework on ESP32). Adjust **RELAY_ACTIVE** to `LOW` or `HIGH` to match your jumper setting, and pick a free GPIO.

```cpp
// 1-Channel Relay Module (optocoupler) – ESP32 example
// Requires no special libraries

const int RELAY_PIN = 26;          // choose any suitable GPIO
const int RELAY_ACTIVE = LOW;      // set to LOW or HIGH to match jumper
const int RELAY_INACTIVE = (RELAY_ACTIVE == LOW) ? HIGH : LOW;

void setup() {
  pinMode(RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, RELAY_INACTIVE);
}

void loop() {
  // Toggle the relay every 2 seconds
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, RELAY_ACTIVE);
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, RELAY_INACTIVE);
  delay(2000);
}
```
