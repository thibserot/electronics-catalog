# Piezo Ceramic Elements - AC003

Thin piezoelectric brass/ceramic discs (≈27 mm Ø). They generate a voltage when flexed, so they can be used as **vibration/knock sensors**; driven with an AC waveform they work as a very small **buzzer/sounder**. Choose these when you need a quick impact/vibration input or a lightweight beeper. For vibration sensing, add a high-value load resistor and protect the ESP32 pin from voltage spikes.

## Specifications

From the listing:

- Type: Piezo elements (metal/brass + ceramic)
- Diameter: **27 mm**
- Leads: pre‑soldered wires (varies by batch)
- Pack size: **10 pcs**
- Typical uses: speech/music transducer, percussive sensors, drum pads

*(No detailed electrical specs on the listing. See the generic datasheet above for typical resonance and capacitance of 27 mm discs.)*

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

Bare disc with **two leads**:

- **Any lead → signal**
- **Other lead → GND**
- Polarity isn't important for sensing; for driving as a buzzer, apply a small AC waveform across the two leads.

## Wiring

**Vibration (safe for ESP32 ADC):**

- Solder or clip the disc to the target surface for best sensitivity.
- Connect one lead to an **ESP32 ADC pin** (e.g., GPIO34).
- Put a **1 MΩ resistor** *in parallel* with the disc (from ADC pin to GND) to load it and reduce spikes.
- Add protection: **two 1N4148 diodes** from the ADC pin to **3V3** and **GND** (clamp), *or* a **100 kΩ series resistor** plus the 1 MΩ load.
- Share GND with the ESP32.

**Simple buzzer (quiet):**

- Drive with a small‑signal **AC** (e.g., 2–5 kHz PWM via a **series resistor ≥100 Ω**). For louder output use a proper driver stage.

## Gotchas

- Piezo discs can produce **large voltage spikes** when hit—always use a **high‑value load** and **clamping or series resistance** to protect the ADC.
- Very high impedance → long wires pick up noise; keep leads short or shielded for sensing.
- Mounting strongly affects sensitivity and tone.

## How to use

**Read vibration on ESP32 (ADC + threshold):**

```cpp
// Needs no external libs. Wire disc to GPIO34 (ADC1_CH6).
// Add 1 MΩ from GPIO34 to GND, and clamp diodes or a 100 kΩ series resistor.

const int PIEZO_PIN = 34;      // ADC pin
const int THRESHOLD = 1200;    // tweak based on your hardware (0..4095 on 12‑bit ADC)
const int QUIET     = 20;      // ignore tiny noise

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  analogReadResolution(12);        // 0..4095
  analogSetPinAttenuation(PIEZO_PIN, ADC_11db); // wider range
}

void loop() {
  int v = analogRead(PIEZO_PIN);
  static uint32_t lastHit = 0;

  if (v > THRESHOLD) {
    uint32_t now = millis();
    if (now - lastHit > 50) {      // simple debounce
      Serial.printf("Knock! peak=%d\n", v);
      lastHit = now;
    }
  } else if (v > QUIET) {
    // optional: stream baseline/noise
  }
  delay(2);
}
```

**Tiny beep (very quiet):**

```cpp
// WARNING: Piezo discs are capacitive. Use a series resistor (>=100 Ω).
// For real sound, drive differentially or use a driver. This is just a "click/beep".
const int PIEZO_DRV = 25;  // any PWM-capable GPIO
void setup() {
  ledcSetup(0, 4000, 10);      // 4 kHz
  ledcAttachPin(PIEZO_DRV, 0);
}
void beep(uint16_t ms=80) {
  ledcWrite(0, 512);           // ~50% duty
  delay(ms);
  ledcWrite(0, 0);
}
void loop() { beep(); delay(1000); }
```
