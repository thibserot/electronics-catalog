## Specifications (typical)

- Material: nickel-plated steel spring/plate
- Types: 18650 single-contact **positive/negative plates**; AA/AAA **coil + flat plate**
- Pitch/spacing: depends on cell size (18650 Ø18 mm; AA Ø14 mm; AAA Ø10 mm)
- Mounting: solder tabs; can be spot-welded to nickel strip for packs
- Current: suitable for low–moderate currents; keep contact resistance low

## Wiring

- For **holders**: solder wire to tab, mind polarity (+ plate vs spring − varies by set).
- For **packs**: prefer **spot-welding** to nickel strip; avoid heating cells directly.
- Ensure firm mechanical compression for reliable contact.

## Gotchas

- **Polarity:** verify which piece is + vs − before assembly.
- **Heat:** do **not** solder directly to cell terminals; risk of damage.
- **Spring sag:** long springs add resistance and can loosen; design for compression.
