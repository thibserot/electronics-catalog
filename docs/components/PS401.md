# Multi-output linear power board - PS401

A small utility **power board** that takes a DC barrel input (center‑positive) or a 9 V battery clip and provides several **fixed rails**: **12 V (pass‑through from input), 9 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V**, plus a **USB‑A 5 V** output. Rails are generated by **linear regulators** (e.g., 78xx/7805 and AMS1117‑3.3), not switch‑mode converters. Use it as a quick bench/desk supply to power prototypes and small modules when you need multiple voltages at once.

If you need high efficiency or >~few‑hundred‑mA on low rails, use a DC‑DC converter instead—this board will waste heat because it’s linear.

## Specifications

- **Inputs**
    - **DC‑in barrel jack** (likely 5.5×2.1 mm, center‑positive). Practical input range ~**7–12 V**.
    - **9 V battery clip** (for light loads).
- **Outputs**
    - **12 V:** pass‑through from DC‑in (no regulation other than input source).
    - **9 V:** linear (typically 7809‑class).
    - **5 V:** linear (typically 7805‑class) and mirrored to **USB‑A** port.
    - **3.3 V:** linear (typically AMS1117‑3.3 or similar).
- **Controls & Indicators**
    - **ON/OFF** slide switch; **power LED**.
    - **Jumpers** to route/select rails to the side header pins (labels near jumpers usually read **3.3V / 5V / 9V / 12V / GND**).
- **Form factor**
    - Through‑hole headers for tapping GND and a selected rail.
    - SOT‑223 regulator packages on board.

*(Details like exact regulator models and maximum current vary by vendor; inspect your board markings if you need exact numbers.)*

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

- **DC‑IN (barrel jack):** center‑positive VIN.
- **9 V clip:** alternative input source.
- **USB‑A:** 5 V output tied to the 5 V rail.
- **Header pins:** GND + one **jumper‑selected rail** (3.3/5/9/12 V).
- **Switch:** powers the board on/off.
- **LED:** power indicator.

## Wiring

For an ESP32 project:
1. Feed the board **7–12 V** on the barrel jack (center‑positive) *or* connect a 9 V battery clip (light loads only).
2. Set the header **jumper** to **5 V** (or **3.3 V** if you must power 3.3 V‑only modules directly).
3. Connect **GND** from the board to **GND** on your ESP32.
4. Power your ESP32 via **5 V** (recommended: into the **5V**/**VIN** pin on dev boards) *or* use the **USB‑A 5 V** to feed a USB‑powered board.
5. Keep wiring short and watch regulator temperature if you draw sustained current.

## Gotchas

- **Linear = heat.** The larger the difference between VIN and Vout and the higher the load current, the hotter it gets.
- **Headroom required.** Linear regulators need input **above** the target rail (e.g., 7805 needs ~7 V for a solid 5 V).
- **Do not back‑feed.** Avoid powering the USB‑A input side or feeding 5 V back into the board.
- **9 V batteries sag.** Use only for light/short loads.
- **Common ground.** Tie GNDs if you power other modules from different rails.

## How to use

This is a **power board**, so no code is required. Treat it as a small bench supply for prototypes. If you need USB‑C PD, buck/boost, or higher current, pick a DC‑DC module instead.
