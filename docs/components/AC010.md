# 25mm Fan 12V - AC010

Compact 25×25×10 mm 12 V DC brushless cooling fan with a 2‑pin XH2.54 connector.  
Use it anywhere you need a small spot of airflow: cooling voltage regulators, MOSFET boards, small enclosures, 3D‑printed parts, or tight spaces inside projects.

This is a **12 V load**, not something you can power directly from an ESP32 pin. Drive it from an external 12 V supply and switch it with a MOSFET or driver board.

## Specifications

From seller description (typical values for this fan type):

- **Fan size:** 25 × 25 × 10 mm (2510)
- **Connector:** XH2.54, 2‑pin
- **Rated voltage:** 12 V DC (sleeve bearing version)
- **Rated current:** 0.06 A
- **Power:** ≈ 0.72 W
- **Speed:** ~10 000 RPM
- **Airflow:** ~2.12 CFM
- **Air pressure:** 0.19 inH₂O (approx.)
- **Noise:** ~25.7 dBA
- **Cable length:** ~150 mm
- **Bearing type:** sleeve
- **Estimated life:** ~35 000 h
- **Weight:** ~7 g

These numbers are approximate and may vary slightly between batches. For critical designs, derate current and airflow a bit.

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

This fan is a simple 2‑wire DC fan with an XH2.54‑2P connector:

- **Pin 1 – V+ (12 V DC):** connect to the positive terminal of your 12 V supply.  
- **Pin 2 – GND:** connect to supply ground (and to ESP32 ground when controlled by it).  

There are **no tachometer or PWM pins** on this model; speed is set purely by supply voltage (or PWM on the supply via an external switch such as a MOSFET).

## Wiring

To control the fan with an ESP32 you typically:

1. **Provide power**
   - Use a separate **12 V DC supply** capable of at least 0.2–0.3 A for some margin.
   - Do **not** power the fan from the ESP32 3.3 V pin.

2. **Switch the fan with a MOSFET (low‑side switching)**
   - Use an N‑channel MOSFET (e.g., logic‑level type) to switch the fan’s **ground**.
   - Wiring (simplified):
     - Fan **+12 V** → 12 V supply +.
     - Fan **GND** → MOSFET **Drain**.
     - MOSFET **Source** → 12 V supply GND.
     - ESP32 PWM GPIO → MOSFET **Gate** (through a small resistor, e.g. 100–220 Ω).
     - Optional: 10 kΩ resistor from Gate to Source to keep the MOSFET off at boot.

3. **Protect against inductive spikes**
   - Place a **flyback diode** (e.g., 1N5819/1N4007) across the fan terminals:
     - Diode **cathode** to +12 V, **anode** to fan GND (MOSFET drain).

4. **Common ground**
   - Connect ESP32 **GND** to the **12 V supply GND** so the gate drive reference is correct.

With this setup, the ESP32 only switches the MOSFET gate and never drives the fan directly.

## Gotchas

- **Needs 12 V:** it will not run from 3.3 V and will be weak at 5 V unless you bought a 5 V version.
- **Inductive load:** always use a **flyback diode** and a suitable MOSFET or driver.
- **Startup current:** briefly higher than 0.06 A; leave headroom on your 12 V supply.
- **Airflow direction:** small arrows on the fan frame usually show **airflow** and **rotation** directions—mount accordingly.
- **Noise vs. speed:** at full duty cycle it’s louder; use PWM to slow it down where possible.

## How to use

Very simple example of driving the fan speed with PWM using an ESP32 and a MOSFET on pin GPIO 5.

> **Hardware assumptions**
> - Fan powered from 12 V supply as described in the wiring section.
> - MOSFET low‑side switch on the fan’s GND, gate connected to ESP32 GPIO 5.
> - Common ground between 12 V supply and ESP32.

**Code (Arduino IDE, uses ESP32’s LEDC PWM API):**

```cpp
const int FAN_PIN     = 5;   // GPIO connected to MOSFET gate
const int PWM_CHANNEL = 0;
const int PWM_FREQ    = 25000; // 25 kHz is typical for fans
const int PWM_RES     = 8;     // 0-255

void setup() {
  // Configure PWM channel
  ledcSetup(PWM_CHANNEL, PWM_FREQ, PWM_RES);
  ledcAttachPin(FAN_PIN, PWM_CHANNEL);

  // Start with fan off
  ledcWrite(PWM_CHANNEL, 0);
}

void loop() {
  // Ramp fan speed up
  for (int duty = 0; duty <= 255; duty += 5) {
    ledcWrite(PWM_CHANNEL, duty);
    delay(40);
  }

  // Hold full speed for a bit
  delay(2000);

  // Ramp fan speed down
  for (int duty = 255; duty >= 0; duty -= 5) {
    ledcWrite(PWM_CHANNEL, duty);
    delay(40);
  }

  // Fan off for a while
  ledcWrite(PWM_CHANNEL, 0);
  delay(2000);
}
```

**Libraries needed:**  
- No extra libraries; just the standard **ESP32 Arduino core** (which provides `ledcSetup`, `ledcAttachPin`, and `ledcWrite`).

You can replace the ramping logic with any temperature‑based control, PID controller, or manual control via web UI, MQTT, etc.
