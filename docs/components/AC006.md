# WS2812B - AC006

Individually addressable RGB LED in a 5050 SMD package with an integrated controller (“NeoPixel”‑compatible). Uses a single‑wire 800 kbps protocol to daisy‑chain many LEDs with 24‑bit color (GRB). Runs from ~5 V and is ideal for status lights, indicators, light bars and small animations.

## Specifications

- Package: 5050 SMD, 1 LED + integrated driver per pixel.
- Supply: Typically 5 V (electrical characteristics given for VDD=4.5–5.5 V). Absolute supply rating listed as +3.5 to +5.3 V.
- Logic levels: DIN VIH ≥ 0.7×VDD (so at 5 V, ≥3.5 V), VIL ≤ 0.3×VDD.
- Data rate: 800 kbps single‑wire; GRB byte order.
- PWM scan freq: ≥ 400 Hz.
- Chaining: signal reshaping each pixel; at 30 fps, “not less than” ~1024 pixels.
- Timing (±150 ns): T0H≈0.4 µs, T0L≈0.85 µs, T1H≈0.8 µs, T1L≈0.45 µs; reset low ≥ 50 µs.

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

- **VDD** — +5 V supply  
- **DIN** — Data in (from MCU / previous LED)  
- **VSS** — Ground  
- **DOUT** — Data out (to next LED)

Pin names and order per datasheet. Decouple each LED with a local 0.1 µF capacitor (shown as “104” in the typical circuit).

## Wiring

**ESP32 → WS2812B (single LED or strip):**

- Power the LEDs from a stable 5 V rail. Tie **GND (ESP32)** to **VSS (LED)**.  
- Drive **DIN** from an ESP32 GPIO **through a ~330–470 Ω series resistor**.  
- Place a **large electrolytic (e.g., 470–1000 µF)** across the 5 V rail near first LED to absorb inrush.  
- **Level shifting:** Because VIH is 0.7×VDD, a 3.3 V ESP32 output is *below spec* when LEDs run at 5 V. Use a proper level shifter (e.g., SN74AHCT125/74HCT14) or run the LEDs closer to 4.5 V so 3.3 V meets VIH, if your setup allows.
- For long runs, inject 5 V power every 1–2 m and at both ends. Keep data wire short and alongside ground.

## Gotchas

- Don’t drive **DIN** when LEDs are unpowered (add series resistor + ensure common GND).  
- 3.3 V logic into 5 V‑powered LEDs is out‑of‑spec per VIH; many strips *work* but it’s not guaranteed—prefer level shifting.
- Start‑up can draw a surge; oversize the 5 V supply and add bulk capacitance.  
- GRB color order (not RGB) is expected by default.

## How to use

**Arduino (ESP32) with Adafruit_NeoPixel**


```cpp
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#define LED_PIN  5          // pick any PWM-capable GPIO
#define LED_CNT  8          // number of pixels
Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(LED_CNT, LED_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  strip.begin();
  strip.show();             // turn off all pixels
  strip.setBrightness(64);  // 0..255
}

void loop() {
  // simple color wipe
  for (int i = 0; i < LED_CNT; i++) {
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(255, 0, 0)); // red
    strip.show();
    delay(50);
  }
}
```
