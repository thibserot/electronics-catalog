# TP4056 Li‑ion Charger (Micro‑USB, 1S) — PS201

**Type:** Linear single‑cell charger  
**IC:** TP4056

# Summary / What it does

USB‑powered charger board for a **single (1S) Li‑ion/Li‑Po cell**. Adjustable charge current (up to ~1 A on common boards). **LEDs:** red = charging, green = charged.

# Key specs (from the listing)

- Charge module: **Linear charging (TP4056)**
- Charge current: **1 A adjustable**
- Charge precision: **1.5%**
- Input voltage: **4.5–5.5 V (USB)**
- Full‑charge voltage: **4.2 V ± 1%**
- Indicators: **Red = charging, Green = charged**
- Input connector options shown: **Micro‑USB / Mini‑USB / USB‑C**
- Working temperature: **−10 °C to +85 °C**
- Reverse‑polarity protection: **No** (connect battery correctly)

# How to wire (from listing details)

1. Power the module from a **5 V USB source** (this variant uses **Micro‑USB**).  
2. Connect **one 3.7 V Li‑ion/Li‑Po cell** to the battery pads/connector (observe polarity).  
3. Watch the LEDs: **red** while charging, **green** when full.

# Using with a solar panel (off‑label guidance)

TP4056 is designed for **stable 5 V**. It **can** be used with solar **if you condition the panel** so the TP4056 still sees ~5 V and a current your panel can supply.

**Safe options**  
- **Best:** Use a small **buck/boost to 5 V** between the panel and TP4056.  
  - Panel: **“6 V” nominal** (Voc ≈ 7–9 V), **≥ 6 W** if you want ~1 A charging in good sun.  
  - Set the TP4056 charge current ≤ **0.8 × panel Isc** (e.g., 1 A charge needs Isc ≥ ~1.3 A).  
- **OK for trickle/light charge:** Feed a **5 V USB‑style panel** (built‑in regulator) straight into Micro‑USB.  
  - Expect **200–500 mA** typical on small USB panels.

**Direct panel (no regulator) — not recommended but possible at low current**  
- Use a small **6 V panel (1–3 W)** with a **Schottky blocking diode** (e.g., SS14) and a **reservoir cap** (≥ **470 µF–2200 µF**) on TP4056 input.  
- Limit TP4056 charge current to **≤ C/10–C/5** (e.g., **100–300 mA**) to reduce hunting/brown‑outs when clouds pass.  
- Ensure panel **Voc < 8 V** (TP4056 abs max is 8 V; spikes can damage the IC).  
- Performance is inferior to a solar‑oriented charger (e.g., **CN3065**, PS202).

# When to use

- Pick **TP4056** when your source is **stable 5 V (USB or a regulated 5 V from a panel)** and you need to charge **one** Li‑ion cell.  
- Pick **CN3065 (PS202)** when charging directly from a **bare solar panel** with **varying light/voltage**.
