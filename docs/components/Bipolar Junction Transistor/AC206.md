# 2N3906 - AC206

A small‑signal PNP transistor typically used as a low‑current fast PNP general‑purpose. It’s cheap, common, and easy to drive directly from an MCU pin through a base resistor.

- **Datasheet:** [2N3906 datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/download/data-sheet/pdf/2n3906-d.pdf)


## Specifications

- Type: PNP small‑signal BJT
- Package: TO-92
- V₍CEO₎ (collector–emitter voltage): ≈ 40 V
- I꜀ (max continuous collector current): ≈ 200 mA
- Typical application: low‑current fast PNP general‑purpose
- Package style is usually TO‑92; SMD and other variants exist for some manufacturers.

> **Pinout note** – Pinouts for these parts can vary slightly between manufacturers, especially for 2N/PN and A/C‑series parts.     For many TO‑92 versions, a very common orientation (flat face toward you, leads down) is **E – B – C (pins 1‑2‑3)**,     but always double‑check the datasheet for your exact device or confirm with a multimeter before committing to a PCB.


## When to use

Use **2N3906** as a low‑current fast PNP general‑purpose when you want a cheap, general‑purpose PNP transistor and the ratings above     (V₍CEO₎ and I꜀) comfortably cover your load.     

If you need more current or voltage margin than this device provides, either move to a MOSFET module in the AC family or     pick a beefier BJT.
