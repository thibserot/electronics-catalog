# 2N2907 - AC204

A small‑signal PNP transistor typically used as a robust PNP switch up to ~500–600 mA. It’s cheap, common, and easy to drive directly from an MCU pin through a base resistor.

## Specifications

- Type: PNP small‑signal BJT
- Package: TO-92 / TO-18
- V₍CEO₎ (collector–emitter voltage): ≈ 40 V
- I꜀ (max continuous collector current): ≈ 600 mA
- Typical application: robust PNP switch up to ~500–600 mA
- Package style is usually TO‑92; SMD and other variants exist for some manufacturers.

> **Pinout note** – Pinouts for these parts can vary slightly between manufacturers, especially for 2N/PN and A/C‑series parts.     For many TO‑92 versions, a very common orientation (flat face toward you, leads down) is **E – B – C (pins 1‑2‑3)**,     but always double‑check the datasheet for your exact device or confirm with a multimeter before committing to a PCB.


## When to use

Use **2N2907** as a robust PNP switch up to ~500–600 mA when you want a cheap, general‑purpose PNP transistor and the ratings above     (V₍CEO₎ and I꜀) comfortably cover your load.

If you need more current or voltage margin than this device provides, either move to a MOSFET module in the AC family or     pick a beefier BJT.
