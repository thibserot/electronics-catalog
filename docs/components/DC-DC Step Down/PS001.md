# TPS63020 3.3V Buck-Boost Module — PS001

**Topology:** Non-inverting buck-boost (single inductor)  
**IC:** TI TPS63020


# Description

This module adopts the TI special chip TPS63020 for voltage regulation and regulation, with low output ripple and stable performance. The switching frequency is up to 2.4MHZ, and the output current is mostly greater than 900ma. It provides multiple output versions of 3.3V, 4.2V, and 5V, which is very suitable for various occasions where 3.3V 5V microcontrollers use carp batteries and USB for power supply. Similarly, the module reserves two modes for users to choose from: conventional working mode and energy-saving mode.

The module has a typical voltage up and down structure, with an input voltage range of 1.8-5.5V and an output current of It meets the power supply needs of various models such as STM32, ESP32, and 51 microcontroller, and the board is equipped with Red LED output indicator light and support for power-saving mode to increase the continuity of input devices such as batteries Flight time.

About output

1, the module is not high-power design, but it is suitable for most of the MCU equipment power supply, so do not exceed the following tested limit value when using, especially the load current.

2. The min voltage of the module can reach 1.8V, but the output power is small when the voltage is low, so we recommend using the max output current under different voltage input measured below.

3, about the power saving mode and output indicator, due to the existence of the indicator, the static power consumption in the power saving mode is still high, if the user needs the power saving mode and does not need the indicator light, you can remove the indicator light to reduce the static power consumption.

4, the user can customize the output voltage, short 3V3 pad output 3.3V voltage, the same 4V2 pad output 4.2V, forbid short circuit multiple pads at the same time if you need the output voltage is not within the range of three jumper pads, then you can disconnect the three jumper pads, welding the two 0603 resistors at the position of ADJ, the default welding R1 bit 0Q, R2 is reserved for users. The formula for calculating the output voltage is as follows

R1+R2 =180K*(VOUT* 0.5-1)

The following measurement parameters are measured in PWM mode to obtain module output

max current can be used by referring to the table below

## Ratings (from datasheet/module listings)
- **Input (Vin):** **1.8–5.5 V**.
- **Output (Vout):** **Fixed 3.3 V** (module variant), IC supports **1.2–5.5 V** adjustable.
- **Output current:** Up to **~2 A at 3.3 V when Vin > 2.5 V** (continuous capability depends on Vin/Vout and thermal). Some module listings advertise up to 3 A peak.
- **Efficiency:** Up to **~96 %** (condition-dependent).
- **Switching freq.:** **2.4 MHz**.
- **Quiescent current:** **~25 µA** (IC), modules may quote **≤50 µA** power-save.

> Note: Real continuous current on small boards is typically **~1–2 A** without extra cooling; treat “3 A” as peak/marketing for these tiny modules. (Backed by IC limits in datasheet.)
