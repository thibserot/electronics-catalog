# Key lock switch - OT002

A small **panel‑mount key lock switch** often sold as model **S1201**. It’s a *mechanical, maintained* switch that requires a key to turn between two positions, making it ideal for lockout/enable functions, parental/maintenance overrides, or arming/disarming features. Many S1201 variants allow the key to be **removed in both positions** ("double‑side pull‑out"). If you just need a secure human input (not a powered lock/solenoid), this is likely the right part.

## Specifications

- Form factor: panel‑mount, approx. **Ø12 mm** mounting hole (bezel/stem sized for 12 mm panels)
- Typical rating (per listings): **0.5 A @ 250 VAC**, **1 A @ 125 VAC**
- Operation: **2‑position, maintained** (key turns between two positions)
- Key feature: **Key removable in both positions** on many variants (“double‑side pull‑out”)
- Contacts: usually **2 terminals** (switch closes in ON position). Some variants may differ.
- Material: stainless/metal body; includes **2 keys**
- Intended use: **low‑voltage signal or AC mains switching** (observe rating; do *not* route mains anywhere near an ESP32 board)

> Note: S1201 is a market/model label used by multiple vendors; exact dimensions and terminal layout can vary slightly by batch/vendor.

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

This is a plain **mechanical switch** (no I2C/SPI/UART). Most pieces have **two lugs**:
- **Term1** and **Term2**: the switch connects these in the ON position; open in the OFF position.
- Some variants may mark **C** (common) and **NO** (normally open). Use a multimeter to confirm before wiring.

## Wiring

For use as an **ESP32 digital input** (low‑voltage only):

- Connect one terminal to an ESP32 **GPIO** (e.g., GPIO 23).
- Connect the other terminal to **GND**.
- In code, enable the pin’s **internal pull‑up** so the input reads HIGH when open and LOW when the key is turned (closed to GND).

**Schematic (text):**
```
ESP32 GPIO ---[switch]--- GND
(Use INPUT_PULLUP in software)
```

> Do **not** put mains voltage on the same switch if you also connect it to an ESP32. If you need mains isolation, use a separate mains‑rated switch or an **optocoupler/relay** interface.

## Gotchas

- **Debounce:** Mechanical switches bounce. Debounce in software (or add an RC network if needed).
- **Key removal:** Many units allow key removal in both positions—design your UX accordingly.
- **Variant drift:** Terminal layout and travel can vary between sellers; verify with a multimeter.
- **Not weatherproof:** Exposed lock cylinders can corrode outdoors without protection.

## How to use

**Arduino (ESP32) example** – read as a digital input with internal pull‑up:

```cpp
// Key switch on GPIO 23, wired to GND when ON
const int KEY_PIN = 23;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(KEY_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);  // enable internal pull-up
}

bool readKey() {
  // LOW means switch closed to GND (key in ON position)
  static uint32_t lastChange = 0;
  static bool lastState = true;
  bool raw = digitalRead(KEY_PIN);     // HIGH=open, LOW=closed
  // simple debounce
  if (millis() - lastChange > 20 && raw != lastState) {
    lastChange = millis();
    lastState = raw;
  }
  return lastState == LOW;             // true when ON
}

void loop() {
  if (readKey()) {
    Serial.println("Key: ON");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Key: OFF");
  }
  delay(200);
}
```
