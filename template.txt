I'm working on documenting all the different electronic components i've got and properly indexing all of them in their drawers.
The idea is to print a QR code and a short 1-2 lines description of what the component is or can be used for. The QR code will take me to a more extensive documentation online while the 1-2 lines help me quickly identify what is in that drawer

In some cases, I've grouped similar components in a single drawer (e.g: LDO, battery charger) and put each type of components in that drawer into different zip bag. As an example, I've got an LDO drawer (ID: PS300) and in that drawer i have 2 zip bags: the MCP1700 (PS301) and HT7333 (PS302)

You can find attached all the different ID that are being used and what is the next available ID as a whole or per family. You can also see all the categories that I've defined so far. Those categories aren't fixed and i'm happy to add more when it makes sense.

For each component, I need to generate a md file with the following structure;

---
id: <get the next ID available for that category. e.g: PS303)
name: <component name: will be printed on the sticker>
title: <component name that will show up in the mkdocs nav>
category: <the category of the component>
tags: <list of meaningful tags>
short: <first line on the sticker. Can be properties like input voltage or what it is (reed switch)
use: <very short description (<5 words)>
---

Here is an example for the HT7333:

---
id: PS302
name: HT7333
title: HT7333 (3.3 V Low Power LDO)
category: PS
tags:
  - ldo
  - regulator
  - 3v3
  - low-iq
  - sot-89
short: "3.3V • up to 250 mA • 12V max VIN"
use: "works well with esp32 deep sleep"
---

After that, we should have the following content:

# <component name> - <component ID>

<High level description of the component and what to use it for. After reading that section i should be able at a glance with 90% accuracy to know whether it's what i need or not>

## Links

- **Where to buy:** [AliExpress](<insert the link I gave you>)
- **Datasheet:** [PDF](<retrieve the link for the given component if possible>) 
- **Tutorial:** [Random Nerd Tutorial](<insert the link i gave you>)

## Specifications

<Extract them from the aliexpress description i'm attaching. If there is no description and the component is defined enough, retrieve those details from the datasheet>

## Pinout & Addresses (common breakout labels)

<when it makes sense, explain what each pin is for>

## Wiring

<when it makes sense, explain how to connect it to. You can assume it's going to be used with an esp32>

## Gotchas
<Mention any gotchas. Keep it short and simple. don't overthink it>

## How to use

<when it makes sense. provide a very simple code example on how to use it. Mention which libraries are needed. You can assume it's for an esp32>

Add this at the end of the page:

*QR for printing will appear here after you run the script:*

Remember, the idea is not to re-invent what exist on internet but to give me a quick access to what the component is for and whether i can connect it to my esp32 or if i need extra components to interface it first. I want to get some generic ideas of what the component can be used for (e.d: DS18b20 is a temperature probe with 0.5 degrees accuracy. That's it! i don't need to know it could be used in my heating hive project)

Let me know if you need more details. I don't want you to invent things or extrapolate when you do not know. if you can find the information accurately, just skip the section or mention that there is ambiguity.

Based on the above template and the registry.yaml that i've attached, I want you to generate a downloadable file for the following component:
